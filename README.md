# Multi-label-text-classification
A multi-label text classification is performed using 4 deep learning based model: Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, ELMo and BERT


### Dataset used
- Currently the code is structed assuming input data is from the OPP-115 Corpus (ACL 2016) available at https://usableprivacy.org/data/
-  The OPP-115 Corpus (Online Privacy Policies, set of 115) is a collection of website privacy policies (i.e., in natural language) with annotations that specify data practices in the text
- Each privacy policy was read and annotated by three graduate students in law. 

### Models used to perform classification

1. Word2Vec

2. Doc2Vec

3. ELMo

4. BERT
